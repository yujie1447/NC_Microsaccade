# Code for paper 'V1-bypassing Suppression Leads to Direction-Specific Microsaccade Modulation in Visual Coding and Perception'

1. We provided the code for detecting microsaccade in the script 'MSdetect.m'
2. Dataset corresponding to each figure can be found in 'Data.rar'.
3. We provided the code to generate figures in the published paper. 
   (remember to change the path of the downloaded dataset and code in the script)
